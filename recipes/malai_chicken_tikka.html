      <li>Step 1 - Tenderize the meat</li>
      <p>
        Thoroughly rinse the chicken. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels.
        Since we are making tikkas here, cut the chicken into 1-inch chicken
        cubes. Transfer the chicken to a bowl.Add salt, Fresh lemon juice.Toss
        it well. Allow the chicken to marinate for 30 minutes. This marinade
        gives the chicken a succulent bite.

      <li>Step 2 - Marinade 1</li>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, let's prepare the first set of marinate. In a large mixing
        bowl, add cashew paste. Stir in ginger-garlic paste, green cardamom
        powder, and cornstarch. Add green chilies, salt, cumin powder, red chili
        powder, and garam masala powder. Mix until blended.
      </p>
      <li>Step 3 - Marinade 2</li>
      <p>
        Add yogurt, Cheese, kasoori methi, cream, cilantro leaves, and oil. Mix
        to combine.
      </p>
      <li>Step 4 - Cooking</li>
      <p>
        Add the chicken pieces. Mix to coat the murgh pieces evenly in the malai
        marinade. Cover and let the chicken marinate overnight in the
        refrigerator. Once the resting time is over, preheat the oven 400
        degrees F. Remove chicken tikka from the fridge and thread the pieces
        onto the skewers. Evenly divide the cubes between 6 skewers. Cook the
        murgh malai tikka for 25-30 minutes, turning halfway through to cook
        evenly. Remove from the oven. Generously brush with butter and serve
        hot.
